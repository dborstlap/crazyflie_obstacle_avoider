# Automatic Obstacle Avoidance for Crazyflie Drone using AI_Deck and Flow_Deck

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing automatic obstacle avoidance for the Crazyflie drone by leveraging the AI_Deck and Flow_Deck functionalities. The goal is to enable the drone to navigate through environments autonomously using a camera-based deep learning approach.

### Features

- **AI_Deck Integration:** Utilize the AI_Deck's computational capabilities to process camera input for real-time decision-making.
- **Flow_Deck Utilization:** Incorporate the Flow_Deck for precise altitude control and motion sensing.
- **Deep Learning for Obstacle Detection:** Implement computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect obstacles in the drone's path.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Enable the drone to react and navigate around obstacles in real-time.
